## Abstract

In visualization education, both science and humanities, the literature is often divided into two parts: the design aspect and the analysis of the visualization. However, we find limited discussion on how to motivate and engage visualization students in the classroom. In the field of Writing Studies, researchers develop tools and frameworks for student peer review of writing. Based on the literature review from the field of Writing Studies, this paper proposes a new framework to implement visualization peer review in the classroom to engage today's students. This framework can be customized for incremental and double-blind review to inspire students and reinforce critical thinking about visualization.

## Usage and Modification
